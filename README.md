## Web Scraping and Text Analysis Project: Analyzing Word Frequency in Moby Dick

![_f5f69754-cd13-4c96-bfc3-a5be3ef0aad0](https://github.com/cphoenix-07/Moby-Dick-NLP-Word-Frequency-Analysis/assets/71826054/c27308b3-d158-40e6-b425-9a4fa871ac4d)


### Problem Statement:

In this project, we aim to determine the most frequent words used in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, and analyze their occurrences. We will utilize web scraping techniques to extract the text of the novel from Project Gutenberg, process the text data, and perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks to identify the frequency distribution of words.

### Tools for Text Processing:

This project involves the following main steps:

1. **Request Moby Dick**: Fetch the HTML file containing the text of Moby Dick from Project Gutenberg.
2. **Get the Text from the HTML**: Extract the text of the novel from the HTML using BeautifulSoup.
3. **Extract the Words**: Tokenize the text to obtain individual words for analysis.
4. **Make the Words Lowercase**: Normalize the words to lowercase to ensure consistent analysis.
5. **Load in Stop Words**: Load a list of common English stop words to remove from the analysis.
6. **Remove Stop Words in Moby Dick**: Filter out stop words from the list of words extracted from Moby Dick.
7. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Use nltk to create a word frequency distribution and plot the most common words.
8. **Identify the Most Common Word**: Determine the most frequent word in Moby Dick based on the analysis.

### Quick Start Guide:

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `nltk`.
2. Fetch the HTML file containing Moby Dick's text using `requests.get()` method.
3. Extract the text from the HTML using BeautifulSoup's `get_text()` method.
4. Tokenize the text using nltk's `RegexpTokenizer`.
5. Normalize the words to lowercase and remove punctuation.
6. Load the English stop words using nltk.
7. Remove stop words from the list of words extracted from Moby Dick.
8. Use nltk's `FreqDist` to create a word frequency distribution.
9. Plot the word frequency distribution to visualize the most common words.

### Conclusion:

Through this project, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach to analyze the frequency of words in a text document using web scraping and natural language processing techniques. The methodologies applied here can be extended to analyze the textual content of various sources and derive valuable insights.

For further details and code implementation, refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

**Note**: The most common word identified in Moby Dick through this analysis is 'whale'.
